# Frontend challenge

## Challenge

Modal dialogs are interactive overlay windows that temporarily disable the main content of a web page, focusing user attention on specific tasks or information. They can be used for displaying critical alerts, requesting user input, confirming actions, and presenting additional content without navigating away from the current context.

Build a reusable modal dialog component that can be opened and closed, with customisable title and contents.

## Requirements

- The modal dialog should contain the following elements:
  1. Title/heading string.
  2. Any contents as the body.
  3. A close button that hides/closes the modal when clicked.
- The modal dialog is centered horizontally and vertically on the screen.
- The modal dialog is displayed above a semi-transparent background overlay.

Design the necessary props or configuration options for the modal dialog based on the above requirements.

### Note:

The `<dialog>` HTML element is available but for the sake of of this task, implement a modal dialog without using that element.

## Stretch goals

- The modal can be closed by clicking outside of the modal dialog component, or by hitting the `Escape` key.

## Keep in mind

- This should be a React app with TypeScript.
- We don't want you to spend too long on this task. See how much you can get done in an hour or two.
- Write any tests that are useful. We're not after loads of coverage.
- We're more concerned with functionality at this stage so there are no designs to work to. You're free to make any UI/layout choices you like.
- If you have questions before you start, please feel free to ask them!

Have fun! We look forward to seeing your work.
